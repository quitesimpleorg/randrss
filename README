What is randrss?
================
Normal RSS readers usually fetch all feeds more or less at the same time
at constant intervals. This leaves a signature for anyone who observes
internet traffic. By looking for this pattern, you are more easily 
identified.

randrss fetches all your feeds at random intervals at an random order
over a certain period of time. The feeds will be downloaded and all
you need is a local webserver. The added benefits of this approach are
that you don't have to worry about how your client deals with cookies
etc.

Also, by having only one client fetching the feeds and your readers
pointed to the randrss's downloaded feeds, you avoid certain trackers
that may identify you across devices (google's feed proxy, cloudflare),
because it's very likely that the combination of feeds you read are 
unique.

randrss fetches the feed using Tor.

Usage

First, tweak the shellscript a bit, if you like
The input file has the following format per line:

An optional user agent file contains the user agents we will randomly
use per feed. One user agent per line.
