What is randrss?
================
Normal RSS readers usually fetch all feeds more or less at the same time
at constant intervals. This leaves a signature for anyone who observes
internet traffic. By looking for this pattern, you are more easily 
identified.

randrss fetches all your feeds at random intervals at an random order
over a certain period of time. The feeds will be downloaded and all
you need is a local webserver. The added benefits of this approach are
that you don't have to worry about how your client deals with cookies
etc.

Also, by having only one client fetching the feeds and your readers
pointed to the randrss's downloaded feeds, you avoid certain trackers
that may identify you across devices (google's feed proxy, cloudflare),
because it's very likely that the combination of feeds you read are 
unique. As your feeds are on a single server now, you can isolate your
RSS reader to its own network container so it can only contact that 
server. This is probably what you should do to be sure your client does
not contact the feed servers in any way. In Thunderbird, set 
browser.chrome.favicons to false.



randrss fetches the feed using Tor.

The only drawback of this approach is that the time you get new feeds
is delayed, but that should be acceptable.

Usage
=====
First, tweak the shellscript a bit, if you like
The input file has the following format per line:
url:output file:(optional parameter for the sleep time, in format x-y)

An optional user agent file contains the user agents we will randomly
use per feed. One user agent per line.

randrss [input file] [user agent file]
